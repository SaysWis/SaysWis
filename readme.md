I also hold a Master’s degree in Systems, Control and Information Technologies from Université Grenoble Alpes [UGA](https://master-eecs.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/program/eecs-master-in-systems-control-and-information-technology-eecs-miscit-/eecs-master-in-systems-control-and-information-technology-eecs-miscit--1102022.kjsp) (2021).

In my current role at ESIGELEC, I am responsible for:

- Leading and coordinating the Electrical Engineering specialization, including curriculum design and academic strategy.
- Teaching in the areas of control systems, electrical engineering, and power engineering.
- Supervising student projects and supporting research and industry partnerships.
